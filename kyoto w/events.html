Visitors to Kyoto are more than welcome to join. Just be ready for crowds! </td>

            <td>This is one of our favorite Kyoto festivals. It’s held at Ebisu-jinja Shrine, which is a short walk from either Gion-Shijo or Kiyomizu-Gojo Stations on the Keihan Line. It happens all day from the 8th to the 12th, but it’s best to go in the evenings, when the place gets packed and raucous. Ebisu-san is one of the Shichifukujin, the Seven Lucky Gods of Japanese mythology.</td>

Because it marks a new beginning, it’s the time to caste off old bad things and invite in good new things. At homes, people throw roasted soybeans out the door of their houses while shouting “Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!” (Devils out! Good luck in!).</td>

Lanterns are placed along the lanes and roads of the area, all converging on Maruyama-koen Park, where various light sculptures and installations are on display (provided by Kyoto art school students). </td>

It’s a first-rate performance in every way and you should do everything in your power to catch a performance – it will be unforgettable. Some private tour operators and concierges can help you get tickets to the performances. Check out our Kyoto Geisha page for more details on Kyoto’s geisha.td>

The number of geisha, the constantly changing sets, the outright bizarre sounds from the musicians and singers, it will be like nothing you’ve ever experienced before. If you can go, by all means, GO! You will not regret it.</td>
