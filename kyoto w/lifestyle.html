                        <p>Kyoto has its own –ben, or dialect. It’s a more lyrical and idiosyncratic version of Tokyo’s standardized Japanese. Under Kyoto–ben intonation, for example, the final syllables of both arigato and gozaimasu are raised.</p>

                        <p>Wedged in between mountains as it is, parts of Kyoto Prefecture reach more than 1000 meters above sea level, with the city itself averaging at around 50 – 60 meters. Consequently, it’s much colder in winter than Tokyo, which sits at a low 40 meters above sea level.</p>

                        <p>If you’ve experienced the exhausting humidity of a Tokyo summer, you might find it hard to believe that some urban areas in Japan are even hotter, and Kyoto accomplishes that feat. The city’s geographical positioning inland helped push its July 2017 average temperature</p>

                        <p>Kyoto-ites cool off in summer by jumping into one of the nearby rivers, than hanging around until evening for a beer or two. Although Tokyo also has a number of major rivers and many smaller waterways running through it, Kyoto’s are not only more inviting — urbanization has leeched</p>

                        <p>Most people who live in Kyoto find cycling the easiest way to get around. With an area about 2 1/2 times smaller than that of Tokyo’s central 23 wards, the scale of the city is conducive to bike riding, as is the relatively flat landscape. </p>

                        <p>There are two things in Kyoto that, compared to Tokyo, can be more difficult to find — convenience stores and vending machines.

                        In 2018, Tokyo had 7,280 convenience stores, according to data from the Statistics Japan website. Kyoto, as a prefecture, had 1,086. On a per capita basis, Tokyo ranked number three, with 53.44 stores for every 100,000 people </p>

                        <p>A widely known zoning rule is one that restricts all buildings in Kyoto City to the height of a five-storied pagoda. Construction is also not allowed to damage the scenery of significant culture sights.

                        All this means that apartment housing is relatively rare in Kyoto. Universities have dormitories </p>

                        <p>While the rigors of modern development have hidden much of Tokyo’s heritage, Kyoto’s history is tangible and accessible on a surface level. Living in Kyoto means coming face-to-face with that heritage on a daily basis. It makes a person more interested in the history.</p>
